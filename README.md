# VR_Hospital
A virtual hospital to allow nursing students to continue their education during COVID-19

These are some of the C# scripts used in the VR Hospital project. This is an ongoing project that continues to change and grow as needed. 

Basic Setup:
The majority of scripts are children of the "Visual_Cue" script. Visual_Cue is responible for handling basic interactions with player, while children of this class handle specific interactions. 
Game manager is responsible for handling objectives or "Orders" that the player chooses to do. 
Other scripts are for handling specific information for easy implementation.
